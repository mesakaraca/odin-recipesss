        <p>In a large pot, cook 1 pound of ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. 
        Drain any excess fat. Add 1 diced onion and 2 cloves of minced garlic to the pot, and cook for 
        another 2-3 minutes until the onion is soft. Stir in one 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes, 1 6-ounce 
        can of tomato paste, 1 teaspoon of dried basil, 1 teaspoon of dried oregano, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 
        and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 20 minutes to let the flavors meld together.</p>
    
        <p>Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, mix together 2 cups of ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese, 
            1 beaten egg, and 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). 
            Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange a single 
            layer of uncooked lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping them.
             Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, then sprinkle with 1 1/2 cups of shredded 
             mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers with the remaining ingredients, ending with a final layer of sauce 
             and mozzarella cheese on top.</p>
